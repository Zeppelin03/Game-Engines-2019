#### **Desription**

For my assignment I created a procedural mesh terrian which is generated at launch. The colour of the mesh material changes thorughout the experience based on the music playing. I have also added a particle sytstem which adds snow falling from the sky to the scene along with a free moving camera to allow you to fly around the world to view the terrain.


##Controls
- wasd / arrows	- movement
-	hold shift		- enable fast movement mode
-	right mouse  	- enable free look
-	mouse			- free look / rotation




##**Development Process**
I researched many different versions of mesh generration / terrain generation and using what I had learned from these vidoe along with what we had coverd in lectures I created my own version adding in a colour changer to mesh material.
