**Desription**

For my assignment I greated a procduial mesh terrian which changes the colour of that mesh material based on the music playing.
I have also added a particle sytstem to add snow to the scene.



**Development Process**
I researched many different versions of mesh generration and terrain generation and using what I had learned from this and what we had coverd in lectures I created my own version adding in a colour changer to mesh material.
